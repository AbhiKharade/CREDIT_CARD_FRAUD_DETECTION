**ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection**
**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

Credit card fraud is a significant challenge in todayâ€™s financial world.
This project uses Machine Learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions from large datasets.
We use techniques such as data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model training with classifiers
like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to build a fraud detection system.

**ðŸ“‚ Dataset**

Dataset used: Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset (commonly from Kaggle)
The dataset is highly imbalanced (fraud cases are rare).
Contains transaction details with features like Time, Amount, V1...V28, and Class (0 = Not Fraud, 1 = Fraud).
